Explanation of Apportionment Problems in Mixed-Use Developments - Commercial Property.

1- Sim Lim Tower (Office & Retail)

This development has a mix of office spaces and retail shops.

The apportionment problem arises because office and retail units may have different valuation methods, maintenance costs, and revenue potential.

When calculating ownership shares, voting rights, or en bloc sale proceeds, disagreements can occur between office and retail owners due to differing interests.


2- Burlington Square (Residential & Retail)

This development consists of both residential apartments and retail units.

The apportionment problem is more complex because residential and retail properties operate under different market conditions, property laws, and usage patterns.

Residential owners may prioritize livability and long-term stability, while retail owners focus on commercial profitability, leading to disputes over valuation and en bloc sale terms.


3- People’s Park Complex (Residential & Retail)

Similar to Burlington Square, this development has both residential apartments and retail shops.

The apportionment problem occurs due to different property usage, where retail units depend on foot traffic and commercial activities, while residential owners may be concerned about noise, maintenance fees, and property value.

En bloc discussions can become challenging as residential and retail owners may have conflicting priorities.


4- Orchard Tower (Residential & Retail – Now Church-Owned)

Originally a mix of residential and retail units, the building’s ownership structure changed after a church acquired it for permanent worship use.

This shift in usage affects property valuation and potential en bloc considerations, as a religious institution may not share the same commercial interests as retail unit owners.

The apportionment issue is further complicated by the long-term stability of the church’s ownership, reducing the likelihood of collective sale opportunities.


5- Sim Lim Square (Pure Commercial Property)

Unlike the mixed-use developments above, Sim Lim Square consists solely of commercial units.

This means fewer disputes over apportionment since all owners share a similar business interest and valuation criteria.

Both past en bloc attempts (led by SLP & SRX and ERA with valuations by GB Global and C&W Premas) received strong owner support, consistently above 75%.

The uniform nature of the property makes negotiations smoother, reducing the risk of disputes over valuation and profit-sharing.


Key Takeaway

Mixed-use developments face apportionment challenges due to differing owner interests, valuation methods, and operational concerns. 
Sim Lim Square, being purely commercial, has fewer conflicts, making en bloc sales more feasible.


Enbloc Procedure in Singapore.

1- Requisition for EOGM – At least 20% of owners must request an Extraordinary General Meeting (EOGM) to initiate enbloc.

The People's Park Complex was a commercial housing project undertaken by the newly formed Urban Renewal Department of the Housing and Development Board's Sale of Sites programme. The project was the subject of the programme's first sale in 1967.

Located at the foot of Pearl's Hill, the site where the People's Park Complex currently stands was an open public park.

With a height of 103 metres (338 feet), the 31-storey People's Park Complex building was the first shopping centre of its kind in Southeast Asia and set the pattern for later retail developments in Singapore. 

The shopping centre was completed in October 1970, while the residential block, in 1973. Occupying 1.0 hectare in the heart of Chinatown, the People's Park Complex was the largest shopping complex in the shopping commercial belt along Eu Tong Sen Street and New Bridge Road.

Frasers Tower is a 38-storey Grade A office tower along 182 Cecil Street with lots of green spaces to accommodate the needs of office workers seeking a work-life balance.

Dubbed Frasers Tower, it is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, and will have a total net lettable area (NLA) of approximately 663,000 sq ft.

“Businesses will be attracted to the new landmark as it occupies the prime corridor between the core CBD and upcoming Greater Southern Waterfront development,” said Christopher Tang, CEO of Frasers Centrepoint Singapore.

Unique to Frasers Tower are four community zones designed to promote greater interaction among its occupants, namely The Sky roof garden; The Terrace on level four where people can play foosball; and The Oasis (pictured), an adjacent three-storey cascading retail podium that will house various F&B outlets. The last one is The Park, which encloses Frasers Tower, making it the first commercial building to be nestled within its own park that connects to the Telok Ayer Park.

“The appeal of the development is also in its unique blend of workspace and nature designed to inspire a stimulating, innovative and functional work environment. 

With the reduced office supply in 2018 and beyond, we are confident that demand for Frasers Tower will grow,” noted Tang.

To give tenants the flexibility to efficiently customize their workspaces, the 235-metre tall office building will come with floor plates that are of regular shape and free of interior columns. With sizes ranging from 20,000 sq ft to 22,000 sq ft, each level can accommodate up to 300 people.

The first company that agreed to establish a presence there is The Executive Centre, a serviced office provider which will occupy an entire floor measuring about 20,000 sq ft. 

Other companies from the financial, technology and media sectors have also shown keen interest in Frasers Tower due its prime location and accessible work spaces.

Lucky Plaza is a 30-storey commercial/ residential mixed development situated along Orchard Road, Singapore’s premier shopping district  

Lucky Plaza had proven to be one of the most successful shopping centres during its opening in 1978. 

The success was due as much to the architect’s BEP Akitek Pte Ltd by adopting a concept of an open vertical ‘bazaar’.

With the installation of 2 sets of glass-walled lift or Observatory (Bubble) lift with air conditioning instead of fan has been the most unique feature of the mall.

About this Shop House

This pair of 3.5-storey shophouses is in the heart of Chinatown and within walking distance of Maxwell MRT Station.

South Bridge Road grew in importance when it became a link between the town and New Harbour for Import and export businesses, including assorted wholesale and retail merchant traders, godowns and goldsmith shops between the Chinese community in Chinatown and the European merchants near the Singapore River. 

This area, renowned for its rich tapestry of cultural and commercial activity, has been a vital part of the city’s growth, dating back to when South Bridge Road was a crucial link in the trade routes connecting different parts of the island.

This Shophouse draws inspiration from the passage of time and the rich merchant history of the Singapore River and its surroundings. 

This area, once bustling with merchants and goldsmiths along the harbour, is captured through a very particular use of materials and colours. 

A palette of white, cream and light gold reminisces the shimmer of the river while deeply textured surfaces of stone and timber within the interior evoke a layered history, each contour a fleeting story of the past. 

Ambient and curated lighting highlights these textures and creates a contrast against smooth, porcelain-like finishes, bringing back a sense of the fine craftsmanship and historical significance of its location.

 

In recent years, South Bridge Road has undergone a significant transformation. The street has retained its historical charm while adapting to the modern needs of the city. Many of the traditional shophouses have been beautifully restored, showcasing a blend of Chinese, Malay, and European architectural styles. These shophouses now house trendy cafes, boutique stores, art galleries, and hip eateries, attracting locals and tourists. The area has also seen the rise of boutique hotels and co-working spaces. Despite the transformation, South Bridge Road still retains its cultural heritage, with annual events such as Chinese New Year celebrations and the Mid-Autumn Festival drawing crowds to experience the vibrant traditions of the area. Today, South Bridge Road is a vibrant and thriving destination, blending old and new.",20000.00,2382.00,8.40,1,058826,1.28175883408646,103.845238145025,Telok Ayer Conservation Area,Maxwell MRT,https://pic2.99.co/v3/BJf9kGMKjFtbgZaNqeRx5f?text=Franklin+Lee&sampling=lanczos&version=1&height=300&width=400&mode=fill&quality=70&convert_if_png=true&signature=40f6e3742979f3eaea8de25270a7f0fa6bfdbcc4,https://www.99.co/singapore/commercial/rent/property/telok-ayer-conservation-area-shop-fBXtd5VzbbGyA6743kvekN,0101000020E6100000B38DBB6118F65940BF2A1C8D1582F43F,2025-03-11 17:11:53.3408,2025-03-11 17:11:53.3408,OUTRAM,CHINATOWN

Frasers Tower is a 38-storey Grade A office tower along 182 Cecil Street with lots of green spaces to accommodate the needs of office workers seeking a work-life balance.

Dubbed Frasers Tower, it is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, and will have a total net lettable area (NLA) of approximately 663,000 sq ft.

“Businesses will be attracted to the new landmark as it occupies the prime corridor between the core CBD and upcoming Greater Southern Waterfront development.

Unique to Frasers Tower are four community zones designed to promote greater interaction among its occupants, namely The Sky roof garden; The Terrace on level four where people can play foosball; and The Oasis (pictured), an adjacent three-storey cascading retail podium that will house various F&B outlets. 

The last one is The Park, which encloses Frasers Tower, making it the first commercial building to be nestled within its own park that connects to the Telok Ayer Park.

“The appeal of the development is also in its unique blend of workspace and nature designed to inspire a stimulating, innovative and functional work environment. 

With the reduced office supply in 2018 and beyond, we are confident that demand for Frasers Tower will grow,” noted Tang.

To give tenants the flexibility to efficiently customise their workspaces, the 235-metre tall office building will come with floor plates that are of regular shape and free of interior columns. 

With sizes ranging from 20,000 sq ft to 22,000 sq ft, each level can accommodate up to 300 people.

Other companies from the financial, technology and media sectors have also shown keen interest in Frasers Tower due its prime location and accessible work spaces.",22815.00,1690.00,13.50,1,069547,1.27884346345479,103.847292199676,Frasers Tower,Tanjong Pagar MRT,https://pic2.99.co/v3/7Ze2PG3Jg6mrQmNhiCgqP4?text=Franklin+Lee&sampling=lanczos&version=1&height=300&width=400&mode=fill&quality=70&convert_if_png=true&signature=8b03c762a05cf7291a481753f9ca398bd68a7674,https://www.99.co/singapore/commercial/rent/property/frasers-tower-fnb-bcVYZtQRNo4QxFdcjEFxGC,0101000020E6100000EBF00F093AF65940FBDD43902476F43F,2025-03-11 17:11:53.681848,2025-03-11 17:11:53.681848,DOWNTOWN CORE,CECIL

The Metropolis

With a strategic location along North Buona Vista Drive, The Metropolis was conceptualised to become the gateway to the iconic One North, home to the region’s finest research facilities and business parks. 

Comprising two soaring office towers that are earmarked to serve as headquarters for leading multinational corporations, it will set new standards for prestige, comfort and convenience. 

The Buona Vista MRT Interchange is located right at its doorstep, and it is well-connected to the rest of the island via major expressways and arterial roads.

Awarded the BCA Green Mark Platinum, this architectural marvel has large floor plates of about 29,000 and 27,000 sq ft with column-free spaces that provide complete flexibility and efficiency to meet the demands of 21st century business. 

With a total gross floor area of some 1.2 million sq ft, this much anticipated development was completed in 2013.

Efficient Floor Space

The Metropolis presents functional space to meet the demands of the 21st century business with spacious floor plate sizes:

Tower 1 - 23 storeys featuring floor plates ranging from 19,700 to 30,000 square feet
Tower 2 - 21 storeys featuring floor plates ranging from 10,400 to 28,500 square feet

Its large floor plates of uninterrupted, regular-shaped column-free space and up to a generous 19.2 metres core-to-window depth offer optimal space efficiency and flexibility. 

Raised flooring of 150mm ensures efficient cable management, whilst large windows provide ample natural light for a bright working environment, not to mention great views.

Furthermore, the floor plates are built around a central core that houses the service and maintenance elements like passenger and service lifts, electrical risers and toilets. 

The location of services in the core facilitates maintenance and minimizes disturbance to occupiers.

Features

International corporations deserve nothing less than a grand, secure and efficient environment for their business operations.

From the attractive water features at the arrival plaza, to the landscaped gardens and expansive lobbies for both towers, The Metropolis is the ideal setting for your business. 

A highlight of the development is the specially commissioned sculptures by world-renowned artists like Fernando Botero, Ju Ming and Gao Xiao Wu, which are strategically placed in the development.

Cutting-edge technologies ensure 24/7 operations for the tenants. 

The security system includes CCTV, 24-hour security patrols, and security card access via turnstiles at the lift lobbies and the lifts. 

In addition, the designated high-rise and low-rise lift zones not only save energy but also reduce waiting time for passengers and shorten their travel times. 

An efficient Car Park Guidance System further improves user experience.

Amenities

The Metropolis is conveniently located to take advantage of every amenity.

A plethora of casual dining and leisure options are within walking distance at one-north, Vista Xchange and the pedestrian spine at The Metropolis. 

For after-hours entertainment, the vibrant Holland Village with bars and more restaurants is only a MRT stop away, as are the more bohemian offerings of Wessex Estate. Rochester Park, on the other side of North Buona Vista Road, featuring more chill-out and dining selections in charming colonial bungalows, is a great venue for treating valued clients.

The Star, a new dynamic shopping mall and preforming arts Centre for small and large-scale events is accessible through a direct walkway. 

It includes a 5,000-seat, state-of-the-art theatre for touring concerts, family entertainment, and other large-scale conferences or events.

Eco-Friendly

As a responsible corporate citizen, businesses like yours believe in supporting efforts that sustain the environment. 

At The Metropolis, a range of innovative solutions for water and energy conservation, carbon dioxide emission reduction and responsible construction has been employed to help minimize your impact on the environment.

This has earned The Metropolis the coveted Green Mark Platinum certification by the Building & Construction Authority of Singapore.",19642.00,2207.00,8.90,5,138588,1.30624556811811,103.791237458059,The Metropolis,Buona Vista MRT,https://pic2.99.co/v3/gJHmc7mMQyssa64sE5T5iS?text=Franklin+Lee&sampling=lanczos&version=1&height=300&width=400&mode=fill&quality=70&convert_if_png=true&signature=5b69e98705619a80045476255f7c08f7249e5af9,https://www.99.co/singapore/commercial/rent/property/the-metropolis-office-VJQmqSR8c5GsxrbeQgtpoj,0101000020E6100000F36E6FA2A3F25940AACBB9C061E6F43F,2025-03-11 17:11:54.565699,2025-03-11 17:11:54.565699,QUEENSTOWN,ONE NORTH

Tired of long hours as hawker?

This canteen serves the industrial and office workers in Tuas which have very few eateries. The crowd starts from 5:30am where workers commuting from JB will stream in for early breakfast and then continue all the way to peak at lunch.

So in a sense your work hours will be shortened and concentrated from morning to lunch hours on weekdays as compare to other hawker stall locations.

Units available:
3 x 200 sqft stall 
1 x 400 sqft stall

Already have roast meat, chicken rice, roti prata, nasi padang, mixed veg rice, vegetarian beehoon stalls. 

Suitable for fishball noodles, ban mian, fish soup, yong tau foo, any any other food which is not already in the canteen.

4182,aAbRqMMD6afdWEqsXuQk87,commercial,sale,retail,retail_shop,active,"FOR SALE! Basement corner retail space of 378 sq ft @ SIM LIM TOWER.

SIM LIM TOWER @ Jalan Besar has been a FREEHOLD commercial strata landmark sought lately by ENBLOC INVESTORS for the known lettable spaces for about 158 retail shops since 1980s.

As the property is zoned commercial, the retail space is not subject to additional buyer’s stamp duty or seller’s stamp duty, and is eligible for purchase by both local or foreign buyer (if the purchaser qualifies).
Rare are these full shoppers’ views into a retail shop’s interior display
-	Long side corridor facet has four unblocked glass panels and a glass door at its far end. 
-	Wide open shop front with see-through side glass panel is secured with a roller shutter, facing foot traffic at the basement concourse served by two escalators.

The shop’s rectangular spacious layout with two exits / entries allow partitioned flexibility (subject to MCST byelaws / SCDF approval).

SIM LIM TOWER is under development enbloc purview, has weathered the storms of retail modernisation, standing tall at the corner of cross-road intersections in 17-storey height of mixed development. 4-storey retail shops and 13-storey commercial offices all  enjoy sheltered parking on three storeys for its proprietary owners and tenants. 

SIM LIM TOWER thrives on its founding theme of being an Electronic and Electrical City specialising on small replacement parts and components and finished goods for the households and the electronic, audio-visual and lighting industries and trades. 

Across the roads is the Downtown Line 2 Rochor MRT Station, with sheltered walkways two minutes to Sim Lim Square and sheltered, opened walkways to the Jalan Besar Downtown Line 3 MRT Station, located 5 minutes away from SIM LIM TOWER.

Indeed, this basement corner unit of SIM LIM TOWER @ Jalan Besar is rare location-location-location site for operating a corner shop, outside the City’s Central Business District, just outside the Bencoolen Street and Rochor Road ERP gantry points, opening into the under-construction North-South Corridor.

4702,YR8PsxqRiCCH7qDnbcc5SL,commercial,sale,retail,retail_shop,active,"Investing in Katong Shopping Centre (KSC), or any similar property, requires considering several factors. Katong Shopping Centre, located in Singapore's East Coast area, holds potential for both commercial and real estate investors due to the following reasons:

1. Prime Location
Situated in Katong, a popular and vibrant neighborhood in Singapore's East Coast, the center benefits from high foot traffic from locals and tourists.
Katong is known for its rich cultural heritage, trendy eateries, and proximity to residential areas, making it an attractive spot for businesses.
2. Potential for En Bloc Sale
KSC has been in the spotlight for collective sales (en bloc) in recent years. Investors may see potential returns if the property undergoes redevelopment or is sold collectively at a premium price.
3. Mixed Tenant Profile
The shopping center houses a variety of tenants, including offices, retail shops, and services such as tailors and employment agencies. This diversity provides a steady stream of rental income and reduces reliance on a single tenant type.
4. Freehold Status
Katong Shopping Centre is a freehold property, making it a rare and valuable investment in Singapore, where most new developments are leasehold.
5. Proximity to Amenities
The area around KSC is undergoing redevelopment with enhanced connectivity. For example, the nearby Marine Parade MRT (part of the Thomson-East Coast Line) will increase accessibility.
Proximity to schools, malls, and recreational spaces adds to the desirability of the location.
6. Heritage and Community Appeal
Katong has a unique Peranakan culture and charm that attracts both locals and expatriates, creating a steady demand for commercial spaces in the area.",800000.00,205.00,3902.00,15,437844,1.30381323460706,103.900952077233,Katong Shopping Centre,Marine Parade MRT,https://pic2.99.co/v3/J2hLn6RsZQEhAvdaKWteH3?text=elaine+tay&sampling=lanczos&version=1&height=300&width=400&mode=fill&quality=70&convert_if_png=true&signature=f888f1165949ee9cb8bc0d6eff9649a5571c9614,https://www.99.co/singapore/commercial/sale/property/katong-shopping-centre-shop-YR8PsxqRiCCH7qDnbcc5SL,0101000020E6100000A8BEE632A9F9594034AB2B446BDCF43F,2025-03-11 17:21:36.289581,2025-03-11 17:21:36.289581,MARINE PARADE,KATONG

Call Real Estate Professional Josh Chua from Charm Properties LLP at +6596224017 for an exclusive viewing now. 

Geylang Road is a historic area in Singapore, known for its rich cultural heritage and vibrant history. The shophouses along Geylang Road, with their distinctive architectural styles, reflect the area's multicultural heritage. The Architecture in Geylang is characterized by a mix of styles, including Late, Transitional and Art Deco shophouses. These buildings often feature ornate facades, intricate tilework, and colourful decorations, which are typical of Singapore's Peranakan culture. Many of these shophouses were built between the 1905 and 1945 and have been preserved. In recognition of its historicaI and cuIturaI significance, the URA of Singapore designated Geylang as a conservation area. According to URA's Master Plan 2019.
Geylang is slated for continued conservation and development that respects its historical context. The plan emphasizes the importance of balancing conservation with modernization. 

Highlights of these 3 Shophouses: 

1 . Rare Adjoining Shophouse with the Best Yielding Asset Class
2. Freehold Commercial with No ABSD / SSD 
3. Rare Shophouse Approved Residential 
Apartments 
4. Land Betterment Charge Prepaid 
5. No Setback 
6. 8 minutes walk to MRT 
7. Huge Growth Potential

These 3 Shophouses have approved usage of nightclub, Karaoke Lounge and Restaurant - the most sought after licenses for achieving the highest rental yields in commercial properties without vices. 

Post A&A, this site will yield: 

1 . 723.6 sqm of Shop (about 60% of total GFA) 

2. 477.2 sqm of Residential (about 40% of total GFA) 

Total GFA : 1,200.8 sqm (12,925 sqft)
